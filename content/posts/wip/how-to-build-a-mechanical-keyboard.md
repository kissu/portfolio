# How to build a mech keyboard

## Parts needed
- Case: external part that will pretty much stay on your desk
- Switches: mechanical mechanism itself, that will provide you with the super tasty feeling under your fingers
- PCB: board that will send all the inputs to your PC
- Keycaps: actual plastic parts on which you do press, usually with lettering
- Plate: metalic part that will make your typing experience more sturdy
- Stabs: kind of long wires for longer keys, they are used for backspace, shift(s) or enter keys
- USB cable: can be handy if your keyboard is not wireless

And that is pretty much what you do actually need for a basic keyboard.

Of course, you can add a lot more stuff depending on what you're looking for and what is your wished budget.

## Additional stuff
- Nylon washers or [nylon screws](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012TAFF58/ref=ox_sc_mini_detail?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A1THAZDOWP300U) to prevent short in screw-in stabs
- Lube: the most used ones are [Superlube](https://www.amazon.com/Synco-Superlube-Multi-Purpose-Grease-21030/dp/B07K71XDQR/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=superlube&qid=1561584040&s=gateway&sr=8-4) for stabs, Trybosis 3204 (or 3203) and maybe Krytox 205g0.
- [Switch opener/puller](https://kbdfans.cn/products/product): will help safely removing (if hotswappable PCB) and opening switches before lubbing them.
- [keycap puller](https://www.banggood.com/fr/Keyboard-Key-Keycap-Puller-Key-Cap-Remover-With-Unloading-Steel-Cleaning-Tool-p-1036566.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN): to remove safely your keycaps from your switches
- [sorbothane](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019GBMG14/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A1EPE8IE7JPHY4&psc=1): the most efficient (and expensive) foam to dampen the sound of a KB, neoprene inside of keycap modifiers may maybe help too
- [brushes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072BM21NV/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2607QEGM8G1T2&psc=1): to apply lube
- [switch films](https://txkeyboards.com/en/products/switch-films-intl-detail): to reduce wobble and make switches more consistent
