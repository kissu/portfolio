I wanted to do it a long time ago...

So I've decided to do that simple blog thanks to the help of this [repo](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome-starter-blog).
Clean, simple and efficient way to quickly start blogging. On top of that, I could learn some GraphQL too, thanks to [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/).

I've made this choice essentially because I'm not really into proprietary solutions with a lot of ads/paywall/and so on (Medium), neither I am into paid solutions (Ghost).

And what is better than a personnal cool blog. Okay...the personnal part may come later on. With a proper Japanese or even Cyberpunk theme. The teaser is real...

But for the moment, I'll focus only on delivering good quality blog posts.
